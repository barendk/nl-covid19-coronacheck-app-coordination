## Architecture documentation

The CoronaCheck Architecture and development documentation can be found in the [architecture/](architecture/) folder.

A good starting point with an overall view of the system is the [COVID-19 CoronaCheck - Solution Architecture](https://github.com/minvws/nl-covid19-coronacheck-app-coordination/blob/main/architecture/Solution%20Architecture.md)

## Provider documentation

This repository used to also include documentation for providers. A while ago we have moved all documentation for vaccination, test and recovery providers into a [single repository](https://github.com/minvws/nl-covid19-coronacheck-provider-docs)

## Development & Contribution process

The development team works on the repository in a private fork (for reasons of compliance with existing processes) and shares its work as often as possible.

If you plan to make non-trivial changes, we recommend to open an issue beforehand where we can discuss your planned changes.
This increases the chance that we might be able to use your contribution (or it avoids doing work if there are reasons why we wouldn't be able to use it).

Note that all commits should be signed using a gpg key.
